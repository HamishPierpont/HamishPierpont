### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Hamish!

- ðŸ”­ I recently graduated with honors from the University of Florida with a BS in mathematics and computer science. Go gators!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently taking a brief break from computer science learning, but I'll start right back up again next month when I begin working as a software engineer at Capital One.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
  - zhamish.zpierpont@zufl.zedu (remove the zs)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/ham
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm the second programmer in my family! My dad programmed in grad school on punch cards.
